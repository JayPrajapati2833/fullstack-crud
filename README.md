"A robust Next.js CRUD application built with TypeScript, React, and CSS, featuring secure user authentication via NextAuth.js with session management and JWT. The app starts with a sign-in page and validates users through Mock API. Invalid users see an error, while valid users are redirected to a dynamic user management page with full CRUD functionality. Add and edit forms come with real-time mobile number and email validation. This efficient app highlights advanced validation, seamless API integration, and clean code structure, making it an ideal showcase for modern web development practices."
